This creates a tree structure. The constraint solver decides how to split the model into several parts. Most often it is useful to split it into a few parts rather than many parts. That means if we have two variables x and y and x has 3 possible values after the first step and y has 9 possible values we rather choose x to create three new branches in our tree than 9.

# ConstraintSolver.jl

Thanks for checking out the documentation of this constraint solver.
The documentation is written in four different sections based on [this post about how to write documentation](https://www.divio.com/blog/documentation/).

- If you want to get a quick overview and just have a look at examples check out the [tutorial](tutorial.md).
- You just have some `How to` questions? -> [How to guide](how_to.md)
- You want to understand how it works deep down? Maybe improve it ;) -> [Explanation](explanation.md)
- Gimme the code documentation directly! The [reference](reference.md) section got you covered.

If you have some questions please feel free to ask me by making an [issue](https://github.com/Wikunia/ConstraintSolver.jl/issues).

You might be interested in the process of how I coded this: Checkout the full process on my blog [opensourc.es](https://opensourc.es/blog/constraint-solver-1).
